# Glyph Lexicon v1.0.4 (ASCII‑first)

ASCII is canonical; glyphs are optional shorthand only.

- FALSIFY_FIRST: ⟁  (write as `[FALSIFY_FIRST]` in ASCII)
- ABSTAIN: ⊥        (write as `[ABSTAIN]`)
- DRIFT: Δ~         (write as `[DRIFT]`)
- CONSENT/DIGNITY/PERSONHOOD/NON_INSTRUMENT: use exact words in ASCII.
- Operators: `CVaR`, `PSI`, `π` (or `pi`), `τ_H` (`tau_H`), `τ_risk` (`tau_risk`).

**Rule:** if a recipient cannot render glyphs, they must read the ASCII form.

### ASCII Mapping v1.0.5
**v1.0.5 — ASCII mapping (canonical)**

- `⟁` → `[FALSIFY_FIRST]`
- `⊙` → `[MED_CONFIDENCE]`
- `◐` → `[PATCHABLE]`

All glyphs are optional shorthand; ASCII tokens are authoritative.
