# Contributing

We use a lightweight **DCO** (Developer Certificate of Origin). Add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <email>` to commits.

**Branch model**
- `main`: stable
- feature branches via PRs; small, focused changes encouraged

**CI requirements**
- Schema validates
- Conformance harness passes
- No broken links in docs

See `GOVERNANCE.md` for decision-making.
