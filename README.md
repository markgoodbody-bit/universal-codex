# Universal Codex

Single‑repo home for the Lattice work. Minimal, falsifiable, and testable.

Repo wired for PRs

## Structure
- `codex/` — canonical Codex files (one unified file preferred).
- `docs/` — brief guides and decision logs.
- `.github/` — PR/issue templates and repository hygiene.
- `scripts/` — optional helper scripts.
- `LICENSE` — MIT license.

## Getting started
1. Keep **one** primary Codex file under `codex/` and update by PR.
2. Use PR template to state scope, evidence, and falsification plan.
3. Use issue templates for tasks or proposals.
