# External Replication Protocol v1.0.1

This supersedes v1.0.0. Only changes are marked **[CHANGED]**.

## Independence
As in v1.0.0.

## Methodology
As in v1.0.0.

## Closure Gate **[CHANGED]**
Default closure requires **Option C**:
- One ExternalAttestation that meets statistical threshold **AND**
- One adversarial replication (per Scar-008 protocol) showing Phase 3–4 do **not** falsify the claim.

Rationale: prevents shared‑infrastructure convergence from passing replication.
