## v2.1.7

- **New:** schemas/provenance_v0.json + example manifest (signed lineage + audited pairwise overlap cap).
- **Harness:** --strict semantic tripwires (e.g., harm_weights must sum to 1.0; overlay allowlist; fairness/dual-sig guards).
- **Conformance:** Added GOLD-011 (strict pass) and GOLD-012 (strict-fail demo).
- **Repo hygiene:** .editorconfig + .gitattributes (LF, UTF-8 no BOM); normalized endings.
- **Docs:** stubs for kernel aggregation & overlay merge; provenance doc.
